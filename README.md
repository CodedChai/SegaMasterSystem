# Ports

How the 4 main processors interact. They use the Z80's IN and OUT instructions.

* 0x7E : Reading: returns VDP V counter. Writing: Writes data to Sound Chip.
* 0x7F : Reading: returns VDP H counter. Writing: Writes data to Sound Chip (same as above).
* 0xBE : Reading: reads VDP data port. Writing: Writes VDP data port.
* 0xBD = 0xBF : Reading: Gets VDP status. Writing: Writes to VDP control port.
* 0xC0 = 0xDC : Reading: Reads joypad 1. Writing: N/A
* 0xC1 = 0xDD : Reading: Reads joypad 2. Writing: N/A

# Memory

* 0x0000-0x3FFF : ROM Slot 1
* 0x4000-0x7FFF : ROM Slot 2
* 0x8000-0xBFFF : ROM Slot 3 / RAM Slot    RAM banking takes priority over ROM banking.
* 0xC000-0xDFFF : RAM
* 0xE000-0xFFFF : Mirrored RAM

It is important to remember that even though these pages can be swapped in and out at any point the first 0x400 bytes of slot 1 does not get paged out. This is because the interrupt handler routines are at this address space and they need to always be present so interrupts can get handled correctly. This means that address range 0x0-0x400 is always data of page0 0x0-0x400.

The memory mapping registers are address 0xFFFC-0xFFFF

* 0xFFFC: Memory Control Register
* 0xFFFD: Writing a value to this address maps that values page into slot 1
* 0xFFFE: Writing a value to this address maps that values page into slot 2
* 0xFFFF: Writing a value to this address maps that values page into slot 3

### Memory Control Register

Games only used bits 2 and 3 of the MCR byte(0xFFFC). Bit 3 was set if RAM was mapped into Page Slot 3 as opposed to the ROM. If RAM banking is enabled then bit 2 selects which of the 2 ram banks gets banked into slot 3. If the bit is '1' then the second ram bank is used, otherwise it will use the first.

# Z80

An 8-bit microprocessor which has 8 standard registers, 8 shadow registers, 2 index registers, 1 refresh register and 1 interrupt vector register. It also includes stack, program counter and 8 flags, although only 6 of the flags were used in the SMS's Z80.

### The Registers

The 8 standard 8-bit registers:
* A - Accumulator
* B - General Purpose
* C - General Purpose
* D - General Purpose
* E - General Purpose
* F - Flag Register
* H - Address Register
* L - Address Register

However, the registers can be paired to form 4 sets of 16 bit registers. The pairings are:
* AF
* BC
* DE
* HL - Commonly used as a pair since the Z80 address space is 16-bit

There are also 8 shadow registers that can not be modified directly by any Z80 instruction. They are named the same as the standrd registers but with a ' after the letter and can be paired in the same way. Their purpose is to be exchanged with their corresponding standard register. So you could swap standard register AF with shadow register AF'.

The 2 index registers, IX and IY, are used with two opcode prefixes which replaces the registes H and L for instructions that use registers HL. For example, ADD HL, HL would become ADD IX, IX for one opcode prefix and ADD IY, IY for the other. When an instruction uses HL for memory access an 8-bit offset is added to IX and IY.

The refresh register is a counter that gets incremented everytime an opcode gets fetched. Usually used to create random numbers.

The interrupt register works with interrupt mode 2.

### The Flags

6 bits in the 8-bit flag register represents a flag.

* Bit 7 - (S) Sign Flag: The sign flag is simply a copy of the 7th bit of the result of a math Z80 instruction. However with some 16bit instructions it will be a copy of the 15th bit of the resulting operation.
* Bit 6 - (Z) Zero Flag: The zero flag is set when the result of an operation is zero.
* Bit 5 - N/A
* Bit 4 - (H) Half Carry Flag: The Half carry flag is set if a subtract operation carried from bit 4 to bit 3 or, or with an 16 bit operation carried from bit 12 to 11. With addition operations it is set if carried from bit 3 to 4 or with 16 bit addition 11 to 12.
* Bit 3 - N/A
* Bit 2 - (P/V) Parity or Overflow Flag: The Parity or Overflow flag has two meanings. Some instructions use the parity flag which means it gets set if the result of the operation has an even number of bits set. The overflow flag is used by some instructions when the 2-complement of the result does not fit within the register.
* Bit 1 - (N) Subtract Flag: The subtract flag is simply set when the instruction is a subtraction.
* Bit 0 - (C) Carry flag: The carry flag is set when the instruction overflows its upper or lower limits.

### Program Counter and Stack Pointer

The program counter points to the address of the next opcode in memory to execute. The stack pointer points to the next address space where a value that gets added to the stack is stored. The stack is initialized to address 0xDFF0 so if a value is pushed to the stack it gets added to and the stack pointer gets decremented to 0xDFEF. 

Both program counter and stack pointer need to be of size WORD since the address space is 0x10000 in size. This size will also be applied to the refresh register and interrupt register.

# VDP

It is a Texas Instruments TMS9918a and there is a lot to it.

### VDP Memory Map

* 0x0000 - 0x1FFF = Sprite/Tile Patterns (numbers 0-255) 
* 0x2000 - 0x37FF = Sprite/Tile Patterns (numbers 256-447)
* 0x3800 - 0x3EFF = Name Table 
* 0x3F00 - 0x3FFF = Sprite Info Table

HOWEVER, the name table and sprite info table don't always begin at address 0x3800 and 0x3F00 and can be changed. There is also Color RAM(CRAM) which holds 2 16-bit color palettes.

### Tile and Sprite Rendering

The screen is made up of tiles which represent the background. Each tile in memory is made up of 64 pixels, 8x8 sprites. To draw the background you read the contents of the name table which will give you all the tile numbers from left to right and top to bottom of the screen. Each tile number can then be looked up in the sprite/tile patterns number which gives the color of each of the 64 pixels of that sprite/tile. The screen is also made up of active objects. These sprites are usually drawn on top of the background and can be 8x8 or 16x16. It is also possible to zoom sprites which doubles the sprite size, so 8x8 becomes 16x16 and 16x16 becomes 32x32. The sprite info table specifies where on screen the sprite pattern is drawn. So the sprite pattern is looked up in the sprite info table and drawn the same way as the background.

### Overview of Registers, Modes and Ports

The VDP has 11 control registers and 1 status register. The status register is a BYTE in size but only bits 5-7 are used like so:
* Bit 7 - VSync Interrupt Pending
* Bit 6 - Sprite Overflow
* Bit 5 - Sprite Collision
* Bits 4-0 - N/A

The VDP can have its mode changed which will change how the tiles and sprites are rendered and also how the status register and the control registers are interpreted. The SMS only uses mode 2 and mode 4. In fact, every game uses mode 4 except for a game called F-16 Fighter which uses mode 2(from what I can tell).

Like all the hardware on the SMS the CPU communicates with the VDP by ports and it is the ports that the programmer uses to control the VDP. The ports are:
* 0x7E - VCounter(Read Only)
* 0x7F - HCounter(Read Only)
* 0xBE - Data Port(Read/Write)
* 0xBF - Control Port(Read/Write)
